- ✅ Error handling for failed operations

**Dependencies:** Milestone 1 (Agent Connection)

**Planning:** [task_plan.md](task_plan.md) | [findings.md](findings.md) | [progress.md](progress.md)

**Completed:** 2026-01-10 (commits: 1b52342, 19ed5ef, 7c0aa35)

---

## Milestone 3: Log Streaming ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Real-time log streaming from containers to UI

**Duration:** 1 day (2026-01-10)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Agent streams container logs via Docker SDK (multiplexed stream format)
- ✅ Durable Object forwards logs to UI clients (pub/sub with circular buffer)
- ✅ UI displays real-time logs with auto-scroll
- ✅ Log filtering (by stream: stdout/stderr, by search term)
- ✅ Last 1000 lines cached for new UI connections
- ✅ Terminal-like viewer with Dracula color scheme
- ✅ Pause/Resume, Clear logs, Auto-scroll controls
- ✅ Connection status indicator and auto-reconnect

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ User opens log viewer → sees live logs streaming
- ✅ Logs appear in UI <100ms after container outputs (real-time)
- ✅ Multiple users can watch same logs simultaneously
- ✅ Cached logs delivered immediately to new subscribers

**Dependencies:** Milestone 2 (Container Control)

**Planning:** [task_plan.md](task_plan.md) | [findings.md](findings.md) | [progress.md](progress.md)

**Completed:** 2026-01-10 (Session 5 - End-to-end testing successful)

### Implementation Highlights
- **Agent**: Go channels for async log streaming, context-based cancellation
- **Manager**: Pub/sub via Durable Objects, reference counting for stream lifecycle
- **UI**: Custom React log viewer with react hooks, WebSocket with exponential backoff
- **Message Protocol**: log.subscribe, log.line, log.history, log.stream.start/stop

### Known Limitations
- **Container restart handling**: If a container restarts while viewing logs, the log stream ends (Docker EOF) and doesn't automatically resume. User must close and reopen the log viewer.
  - **Workaround**: Close log viewer, wait for container to restart, then reopen
  - **Impact**: Minor UX issue for rare scenario (active log viewing during restart)

### Future Enhancements (Milestone 3.x)
- **Auto-reconnect on container restart**: Detect when container restarts and automatically resume log stream without user intervention
- **Server-side log filtering**: Filter logs by pattern/level on agent before sending to manager (reduce bandwidth)
- **Log level detection**: Parse common log patterns (INFO, WARN, ERROR) for color-coding
- **Log export**: Download logs to file (last N lines or time range)
- **Multi-container view**: View logs from multiple containers in split panes
- **Log timestamps toggle**: Option to hide timestamps for cleaner view
- **Log search history**: Remember recent search terms

- ✅ UI form to create new Zomboid server
- ✅ ENV variable configuration (server name, passwords, beta branch)
- ✅ Manager sends server config to agent
- ✅ Agent uses Docker SDK directly (not docker-compose)
- ✅ Agent deploys container using steam-zomboid image
- ✅ Delete server functionality (soft delete + purge)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ User fills form → Server created on agent's machine
- ✅ Server appears in UI with correct config
- ✅ Server starts successfully with configured ENV vars
- ✅ User can delete server → Container removed cleanly

**Additional Features Delivered:**
- ✅ Port validation with conflict detection and auto-suggestion
