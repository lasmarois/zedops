# Goal #8 Progress Log

## Pre-planning — 2026-02-07
- Discovered gap during Goal #7 testing: rebuild fails on Missing server (400 error)
- Restore flow only restores DB record, doesn't recreate container
- Researched all related flows: create, rebuild, restore, sync, start
- Created planning files in `.planning/iced/goal-8-server-recreate/`
- Goal iced — will resume after Goal #7 is fully wrapped up
